# Language Detector ðŸ“œ
### Introduction
Welcome to the Tatoeba Language Detection! This project aims to provide a simple and efficient language detection system using scikit-learn pipeline to combine a TF-IDF vectorizer with a Logistic Regression classifier to detect the language of a given text. The model is trained on the Tatoeba dataset, a large corpus of parallel texts in over 220 languages.
