## Introduction
#### Welcome to the Tatoeba Language Detection! 
Language detection is a common task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves determining the language in which a given text is written. This provides a simple and efficient language detection system using scikit-learn pipeline to combine a TF-IDF vectorizer with a Logistic Regression classifier to detect the language of a given text. The model is trained on the Tatoeba dataset, a large corpus of parallel texts in over 220 languages.
