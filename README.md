# Language Detection ðŸ“œ
### Overview
Tatoeba Language Detection is a Python module for identifying the language of a given text using scikit-learn. This module utilizes a machine learning model based on a scikit-learn Pipeline, combining a TF-IDF vectorizer with a Logistic Regression classifier. The TF-IDF vectorizer extracts character-level n-grams (1 to 3 grams) from the input text, and the Logistic Regression classifier predicts the language of the text based on these features.
